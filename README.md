# UVM-Career-Quiz

## Project Overview
The Career Quiz (CQ) is a series of 4 short quizzes to help students identify career paths and take actionable steps towards developing their career readiness. Currently implemented using Qualtrics, the system is not optimized for its purpose, creating inefficiencies and limiting its reach. This project aims to develop an open-source solution to enhance the design, functionality, and scalability of the Career Quiz, benefiting not only students at the University of Vermont (UVM) but also other institutions looking to implement similar tools.

## Project Goals
* Improved Design: Create a user-friendly and intuitive platform for career development.
* Scalability: Enable other institutions to replicate and adapt the tool to their needs.
* Automation: Streamline the generation of next steps, tasks, and email reminders based on quiz results.
* Integration: Ensure compatibility with institutional systems like Navigate for record-keeping.
* Accessibility: Encourage widespread use among students, faculty, and advisors.

## Project Requirements

### Core Features

1) Dynamic Question Branching: Allow quiz questions to adapt based on previous answers for a personalized experience.
2) Automated Recommendations: Generate tailored tasks and email reminders upon quiz completion.
3) Data Management: Maintain records of completions, ideally integrating with platforms like Navigate.

### User Experience
Develop an easy-to-use interface for students, faculty, and administrators. It needs to include analytics dashboards to track participation and results.

### Technical Requirements
* Build the solution using open-source technologies.
* Ensure the platform is modular and customizable for other institutions.
* Support secure data handling and privacy compliance.

## Community Engagement
Provide clear documentation to encourage adoption and adaptation andf oster a community of contributors to improve the tool over time.

## FAQs
Why redesign the Career Quiz (CQ)?
The current implementation in Qualtrics is limited in functionality and scalability. A purpose-built open-source platform can better support the career success of all students. Moreover, tools like this are designed to promote equity: to support those who might be starting at a disadvantage in terms of their social or cultural capital, and who therefore stand to gain the most.

How will dependent question branching work?
The quiz will adapt dynamically to user responses, offering a customized experience that aligns with their career needs.

Who will use this tool?
Primarily students, faculty, academic advisors and career coaches  at UVM, with the potential to expand to other institutions interested in replicating the model.

What systems need to integrate with the new platform?
Ideally, the platform will integrate with Navigate for record-keeping and institutional tracking.

Will this project be funded?
Some funding may be available to support student developers. A cost estimate for development is required to finalize the budget.

What is the current scale of CQ usage?
Usage is limited due to a lack of institutional mandates. The new platform aims to increase adoption by simplifying deployment and enhancing value for users.

What are the next steps after quiz completion?
The platform will automatically generate personalized tasks and send follow-up emails to guide students in their career development.
